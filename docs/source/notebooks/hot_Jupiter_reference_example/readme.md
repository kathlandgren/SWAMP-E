## Reference data

This folder contains the scripts used to generate three simulations of a hot Jupiter which appear in the [QuickStart notebook](https://github.com/kathlandgren/SWAMPE/blob/validation/docs/source/notebooks/QuickStart.ipynb). The scripts include both planetary and simulation parameters. 

Each simulation was run for 1500 h. The reference data provided here are snapshots at 1500 h. The simulations for taurad=0.1 days equilibrate at around 200 hours. The simulations for taurad=1 day and taurad=10 days equilibrate after approximately 1000 hours.

These simulations took between 21 and 24 hours to complete while running simultaneously on a single core.

The resulting geopotential profiles are illustrated below:
