This folder contains the scripts used to generate three simulations of a hot Jupiter. The scripts include both planetary and simulation parameters.

Each simulation was run for 1500 h. The reference data provided here are snapshots at 1500 h. The simulations for taurad=0.1 days equilibrate at around 200 hours. The simulations for taurad=1 day and taurad=10 days equilibrate after approximately 1000 hours.

These simulations took between 21 and 24 hours to complete while running simultaneously on a single core.
